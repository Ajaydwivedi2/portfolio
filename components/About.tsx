            Hey! I&rsquo;m Ajay Dwivedi, I&rsquo;ve been close to a computer
            since an early age, and been passionate about it ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools back in 2010, and
            from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I
            do programming in various languages and technologies, and had the
            privilege to worked in a Recruitment Company and a SaaS Company I'm
            interested in building something awesome with code and automate
            tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile Development, Open
            Source and Competitive Programming
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on
            Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
